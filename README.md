# Reflection

This website has been created as part of my personal learning towards programming. I wanted to create a website using basic web languages in order to learn more about Front-End Development.

My goal with this project was to have a place where I can describe myself, display my current resume and learned skills in Front-End and Back-End and finally show all my personal projects that I have created when developing my programming skills.

Main challenge that I have encountered was using Responsive Web Design principle. I think that I have made a mistake leaving that at the end and focusing mostly on fullscreen desktop version. If I had to go through that project again I would have planned my layout drafts first for both desktop and mobile. After that I would focus on designing a responsive layout using things like coloured boxes to learn how containers would behave when screen gets smaller. Another mistake was to set definitive variables such as 'height' instead of something like 'min-height' and values such as 'px' instead of responsive values such as 'em" and "vw" which basically blocked any responsiveness that would occur automatically.   

I have used very basic web devopment technologies for this website which are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Font Awesome library for icons and some animations.
